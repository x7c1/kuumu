# 📜 Contributor License Terms

Thanks for your interest in contributing!
Before you do, we want to be very clear and honest about how this project is run — now and in the future.

### 🚫 About Free Riders

This project is open source **right now**, but that doesn't mean we want companies or individuals to **take the code, profit from it**, and give nothing back.

To prevent that kind of free-riding, we are seriously considering moving to a more protective license model in the future — such as [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) or a dual-license setup.

We believe in openness, but also in sustainability.

### 🔐 What You’re Agreeing To

By submitting contributions (code, documentation, etc.), you agree to:

- Give the project and its maintainers a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license** to use, modify, and redistribute your contributions.
- Allow your contributions to be included in **future versions of the project**, even if they are distributed under more restrictive or commercial terms.
- **Not expect compensation**, even if the project generates revenue using your code.
- **Not require us to ask your permission again** when changing the license in the future.

This means: **you won’t get a say in future license changes**, and you’re okay with your contribution being used in ways you might not fully control.

### 🧭 Why We're Upfront About This

We don’t want future drama.  
We’ve seen too many projects struggle with contributors feeling surprised or betrayed when license terms changed later.

So we’re telling you now — transparently and respectfully — that this project might not always stay under a permissive license.
We’re planning for the long haul, and that means protecting it from misuse.

### ❤️ Still with us?

If this sounds fair and you're okay with these terms — thank you!  
We’d love your help. And we’ll do our best to keep the project open, useful, and aligned with its community.

If it doesn’t sit right with you, that’s totally okay too.  
No hard feelings — we respect your choice.

# Automated PR Workflow Implementation

## Overview
Complete automation of pull request creation process to eliminate manual browser-based PR creation and improve development workflow efficiency.

## Current Situation
- Manual PR creation process: push branch → open browser → navigate to GitHub → create PR manually
- GitHub CLI is not installed in the development environment
- Time-consuming manual process reduces development efficiency

## Problem Statement
The current PR creation workflow requires multiple manual steps including browser interaction, which is inefficient and interrupts the development flow. The goal is to achieve complete automation where a single command handles everything from branch push to PR creation.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
1. **Single Command Automation**: Execute `make pr` to handle entire PR creation process
2. **GitHub CLI Integration**: Automatic installation and setup of GitHub CLI
3. **Authentication Management**: Persistent GitHub authentication in Docker environment
4. **Automatic PR Generation**: Generate PR title from first commit date with empty description
5. **Branch Management**: Automatic push with upstream tracking
6. **Zero Browser Interaction**: Complete CLI-based workflow

### Technical Requirements
- GitHub CLI automatic installation and configuration
- Docker volume persistence for authentication tokens
- Git commit analysis for automated PR title generation
- Integration with existing Makefile structure
- Error handling for authentication and network issues
- Support for draft PRs and PR templates

### Constraints
- Must work in containerized Claude development environment
- Should maintain compatibility with existing script structure
- Authentication tokens must be securely stored and persisted
- Should handle offline scenarios gracefully

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: GitHub CLI Setup
- Add GitHub CLI installation to Dockerfile
- Set up pre-configured authentication with Personal Access Token
- Configure Docker volume persistence for authentication
- Test CLI functionality in Docker environment

### Phase 2: Automated PR Script
- Develop script to get first commit date from branch
- Generate PR title in "since YYYY-MM-DD" format
- Implement automatic branch push and PR creation
- Add error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration
- Integrate with existing Makefile targets
- Implement pre-push validation checks


## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Dockerfile Enhancement
```dockerfile
# Add GitHub CLI installation to Dockerfile
- Add GitHub CLI APT repository
- Install GitHub CLI during image build
- Ensure CLI is available system-wide
```

### Step 2: Automated PR Creation Script
```bash
# /scripts/create-pr-auto.sh
- Validate git status and uncommitted changes
- Push current branch with upstream tracking
- Get first commit date of current branch for PR title
- Generate PR title in format "since YYYY-MM-DD" using first commit date
- Create draft PR with generated title and empty description
- Output PR URL and status
```

### Step 3: Makefile Integration
```makefile
# Enhanced Makefile targets
pr:
	./scripts/create-pr-auto.sh
```

### Step 4: Authentication Setup
- Create GitHub Personal Access Token with required scopes (repo, workflow)
- Pre-configure GitHub CLI authentication via hosts.yml file
- Configure Docker volumes for GitHub CLI config persistence
- Add authentication validation checks in automation script

## Success Criteria
1. **Single Command Execution**: `make pr` completes entire PR creation process
2. **Zero Manual Intervention**: No browser interaction or interactive authentication required
3. **Persistent Authentication**: Pre-configured PAT setup, works indefinitely
4. **Standardized PR Titles**: PR titles in "since YYYY-MM-DD" format using first commit date
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery instructions
6. **Performance**: PR creation completes in under 30 seconds

## Authentication Setup Process
1. **Generate Personal Access Token**: Create PAT with `repo` and `workflow` scopes
2. **Pre-configure hosts.yml**: Create `claude.local/shared/.config/gh/hosts.yml`:
   ```yaml
   github.com:
       user: your_username
       oauth_token: ghp_your_personal_access_token_here
       git_protocol: https
   ```
3. **Docker Volume Mounting**: Map the config directory for persistence
4. **One-time Setup**: Authentication persists across container restarts

## Risk Assessment
- **Authentication Issues**: Mitigation through comprehensive error handling and clear setup instructions
- **Network Connectivity**: Graceful offline handling with clear error messages
- **Docker Environment Limitations**: Thorough testing in containerized environment
- **GitHub API Rate Limits**: Implementation of appropriate retry logic and error handling

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: GitHub CLI setup and authentication (2-3 points)
- **Phase 2**: Automated PR script development (3-4 points)
- **Phase 3**: Makefile integration and testing (1-2 points)
- **Phase 4**: Enhanced features and polish (2-3 points)

Total estimated effort: 8-12 points for complete implementation

## Testing Strategy
1. Test GitHub CLI installation in clean Docker environment
2. Verify authentication persistence across container restarts
3. Test PR creation with various commit history scenarios
4. Validate error handling for common failure cases
5. Performance testing for large repositories
